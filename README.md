•	The term ‘Piles’ relates to an audit which is carried out daily.  It measures the number of units which require problem solving at different departments in the workplace.  The audit itself is carried out by the Quality Assurance Department at the earliest time after midnight, the details of the audit can then be commented on by department managers, where, they can action their team to reduce the problems if required.

UX
•	The data collected in the .csv file relates to real time personnel; this is the department I currently manage.

•	This project can assist managers with decision making regarding future training of personnel to obtain higher skills.

•	It will also assist managers (when checking the holiday tracker) to be able to utilise the personnel to cover daily bin checks (direct counting), auditing of department processes and deep dive research processes.

•	The ‘Select all’ will give the user the option to either select all or to specify day or night shift personnel.

•	The ‘Select all’ selector automatically updates the percentage of ‘Gender in the department’ display and the three graphics which are related.

•	All graphics are equally spaced out in different rows to give an uncluttered feel to the dashboard.
